Cucumber Training
=================

***

Training project to run WebdriverIO tests with [CucumberJS 2](https://cucumber.io/). 
Code is written in [ES6](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) and transpiling is done at runtime using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) 


## Requirements

- Node version 6 or higher


## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

1. Clone the git repo â€” `git clone git@github.com:ModusCreateOrg/cucumber-training.git`

2. Clean the project (Optional):
- *On OSX/Linux:*
-- Run `npm run clean`

- *On Windows:*
-- Remove the directories `/node_modules` & `/reports`

4. Install the dependencies (`npm install`)

Now you are ready to write some features.


## Features

- Super simple setup
- Full integration with [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/)
- Full integration with [CucumberJS 2](https://cucumber.io/)
- Full support for [ES6](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
- Runtime transpiling with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (transpiling is a specific kind of compiling)
- Integration with cloud services like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/)


# How to write a test

Tests are written in [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference)
that means that you write down what's supposed to happen in a real language. All test files are located in
`./features/*` and have the file ending `.feature`. You will already find some test files in that
directory. They should demonstrate, how tests could look like. Just create a new file and write your first
test.

__landingPage.feature__
```gherkin
Feature: Test login
  As a QA
  I want to check login functionality
  by using both valid and invalid test data

  Scenario: Login using valid credentials
    Given I open the site landing page
    When I login using email sergiu@moduscreate.com and password dummyPassword
    Then I am successfully logged in
    And I am redirected to Home page

  Scenario: ...

```

This test opens the browser and navigates them to facebook.com to check if login functionality works as expected with both valid and invalid test data. 
As you can see, it is pretty simple and understandable for everyone.


# How to run the tests

To run your tests just call the [WDIO runner](http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/gettingstarted.html):
```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.conf.js
```

_please note_ The WDIO runner uses the configuration file `wdio.conf.js` by default, so the above can be translated into the following, though will almost never be used as _conf_ file will be overridden:
```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/wdio
```

## Running single feature

To run a single feature file using the following command:
```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.conf.js --spec ./features/landingPage.feature
```

# Configurations

To configure your tests, checkout the [`wdio.conf.js`](https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate/blob/master/wdio.conf.js) file in your test directory. It comes with a bunch of documented options you can choose from.

## Environment-specific configurations

You can setup multiple configs for specific environments. Let's say you want to have a different `baseUrl` or different test packs for your local and pre-deploy tests. 
Use the `wdio.conf.js` to set all general configs (like cucumberOpts) that don't change.
It will be the _default_ or _base_ config file. For each different _environment_ or _configuration_ you can create a new config with the following name
scheme:

```txt
wdio.<ENVIRONMENT>.conf.js
```

Now you can create a specific config for your pre-deploy tests:

__wdio.PR_VALIDATION.conf.js__
```js
var config = require('./wdio.conf.js').config;

config.baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8080';

exports.config = config;
```

Your environment-specific config file will get merged into the default config file and overwrites the values you set.
To run a test in a specific environment just add the desired configuration file as the first parameter:

__NOTE:__ import does not work at this level as Babel runtime transpiling is not available here.

```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.PR_VALIDATION.conf.js
```
 
 
# Adding new steps and snippets

In order to make benefit of the IDE CucumberJS plugins all step definitions should be stored in `/step_definitions`. They
can be separated by _pageObject_ / _functionality_ / _application flows_ / etc. 

Snippet definitions are using regular expressions. This is pretty powerful as it allows you to create complex
sentences with multiple options. Everything that's within `"([^"]*)?"` gets captured and appended to the
callback. The last argument is always a callback function.
You can access the browser and your WebdriverIO instance with `browser`.

To assert values this training project comes with a [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) integration.


# Comments

You can add additional descriptive comments in your feature files.

```gherkin
###
  This is a block comment
  that can spread across multiple lines.
###
Feature: Test login
  As a QA
  I want to check login functionality
  by using both valid and invalid test data

# This is a single line comment
  Scenario: Login using valid credentials
    Given I open the site landing page
    ...
```
